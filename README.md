# NightsWatchParty
Their are 19 towers along the Wall, manned by the Night's Watch.

Seperated from their brothers, spread thin all along the Wall into more castles than the Watch can staff sufficiently - the silence, loneliness, and isolation are enough to drive a man insane.

Besides, for the greater part of the year there is no wildling activity, and the brothers of The Watch drown in boredom.

This is a tool for the brotherhood to catch a reprieve. Using the magic of the Three Eyed Raven, it allows the brothers to watch movies and videos together, and join each other in conversation. Separated physically, united virtually, this is one of the thin barriers keeping the men from insanity.
In simple words, clone of Netflix watch party for other websites. :P
